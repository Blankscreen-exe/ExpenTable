# Expentable

This is an expendable time table which you can easily use to plan your week ahead of time. I saw many daily planner apps and felt that they were quite over whelming and it it took a lot of time to plan each specific activity. Overpowered daily planners like those are not feasible since they should be saving your time, instead you spend a lot of time to just make that planner perfect. With Expentable I am trying to change that. It is a very simple app which aims to under do most of the "modern" bloated planner apps and provide you with a simple, less time-consuming and efficient plans.

## Features

### Weekly Plans

This app only works for a weekly plan. Planning too less can invite a lot of miscalculations, on the other hand planning too much is just preparing to panic when things go haywire.

### Perfect Privacy

The data is not stored anywhere other than your device. There are no servers included. Everything you input or type will stay within your device, giving you complete and perfect privacy.

### Pomodoro As Time Units

You assign each task a set of time units. Each time unit consists of one pomodoro timer i.e. 25 mins for works and 5 mins for rest.

### Tasks As Todos

Each task you assign 

### Auto Daily Rotation

Time table will mark today's day automatically and if you choose to, all the timers of te previous day will be nullified, leaving you with a blank slate.
